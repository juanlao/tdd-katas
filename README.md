# TDD Katas Repository

This repository contains the code for different Test-Driven Development (TDD) katas that I have been working on. Each kata is located in its own folder with its respective code and tests.

## What is TDD?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice in which tests are written first, and then the necessary code is implemented to make the tests pass. This methodology encourages modular software design, code quality, and refactoring capabilities.

## Repository Structure

The repository follows a folder structure for each completed kata. Each folder contains the necessary files for that particular kata. Typically, you will find the following elements:

- `README.md`: A description of the kata and the objectives to achieve.
- A solution and xUnit test project with the kata and the unit tests.

## List of Katas

Here is a list of the katas I have completed so far:

1. [Passwords Validator](./passwordValidator)

Feel free to explore each kata and its solutions. You can also contribute by opening a pull request with your own implementation or improvements!
